I had a really good talk with [Chirag Nayyar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiragnayyar) sir on how beginners can get started with Cloud.

I learnt a lot in the two hour session, so I summarized the key points into a two minute read.

## Getting Started with Cloud

Sir strongly believes in a bottom to top approach.

-   Focus on the fundamentals
    -   Networking
    -   Relational Databases (SQL)
    -   Storage
    -   Compute
-   Choose ANY Cloud Platform. (They all have a generous free tier.)
-   Explore the platform.
-   Understand their services. (Co-relate with your foundational knowledge.)
-   Buy a domain.
-   Make a portfolio.

## Important Concepts

-   Networking
-   Relational Databases (SQL)
-   Storage
-   Compute
-   Virtualization (Need & role)
-   Understand '[Software Defined Everything](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software-defined_everything.html)'.
-   Know the purposes of services.

## General Tips

-   Don't follow too many resources.
-   Build a strong foundation.
-   Grow step by step.
-   Nothing is a race.
-   Build things that you like and try to test them in other environments.
-   Try and fail as soon as possible.
-   Share your learning with the community.
-   Own a domain and an e-mail with it.
-   Your portfolio site does not have to be the most beautiful one out there.
-   Put a target date (may be months).
-   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are gold mines.
-   Certifications don't matter. Only the official ones matter and in the case of cloud they have a certain validity, so do them at the right time and use them properly. Learn, don't run after certificates.
