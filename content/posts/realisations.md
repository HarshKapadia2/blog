The following are some of [my](https://harshkapadia.me) realisations and frustrations. **Not facts, just my opinions.** All thoughts are not covered, obviously.

I'll try to keep this updated. No promises though, I guess.

> NOTE: These pointers are not facts. They are just my opinions.

_In my room in the rented house in Boston_

-   Just sitting in class and actively listening and participating can teach one a LOT, especially when the teacher is good.
    -   Credits to [Anil Harwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani) for making me aware about this.
    -   Even if the teacher is not good, some knowledge can definitely be gained.
    -   Prior reading may or may not be required. I don't think interest depends on that though.
        -   Credits to [Kartik Soneji](https://github.com/KartikSoneji) for telling me about this.
-   When typing something while remembering pointers, write stuff out without bothering about spelling mistakes or polished words. Refine later.
    -   Getting the point on the screen without forgetting it is more important than looking into the grammar, typos and exact words.
-   All the cheesy advice seems correct.
    -   Eating healthy, sleeping enough, getting up early and sleeping early, exercise, creating good habits/patterns, planning, etc are all SO very important.
-   Situational awareness helps take good decisions.
    -   Health, sleep, focus, experience and planning dictate this IMO. (I struggle with this.)
-   Mistakes
    -   Best teachers
    -   Learning to identify toxic behaviours/patterns is so important. Curtailing them is the next step that is important.
    -   One should really learn from their mistakes (one-time ones or repeated ones) and try to identify similar situations in the future to be able to avoid those mistakes again. (Refer to the 'Situational awareness' point above.)
    -   Learning from other's mistakes is good as well, but just like all external motivation, it won't be as impactful. That doesn't mean that one shouldn't try to learn from them.
-   Being a good person (in one's opinion) is SO important.
-   Empathy is SO very important. Judge other things less.
-   It is all about bettering oneself, but not doing that to a toxic extent by taking out all the fun.
    -   Optimizing 100% of one's time in NOT good.
-   A lot of us speak from [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).
-   Confidence builds in steps.
    -   Yes, the cheesy advice of building confidence through small wins is true.
    -   Doing the smaller tasks in one's To Do list gives the boost required to tackle the more difficult ones.
    -   Breaking down complex things into palatable chunks makes them look les daunting and builds confidence as these small chunks start getting completed.
-   Trying to reset a bad day is good.
    -   Doing some stress-relieving activities, taking a nap, taking a bath, etc. at such times is good.
-   Procrastination is difficult to get over. It is usually the start that is the most difficult part.
-   Being grateful, down-to-earth and empathetic when one is having a good day is so important.
-   The importance of being honest, grateful, passionate, loyal and trustworthy is underrated.
-   A recurring theme has been that the cheesy things that we have been told since childhood hold true in a lot of situations.
    -   Old people speak from experience. _Am i rite_ or _am i rite_? üòâ

_8th October 2022_

_On the dining table in my (/the?) rented house in Boston_

-   It's good to go through difficult times, as it teaches one a lot.
-   When going through a difficult time, try to look at it as an opportunity and use that time to let yourself feel bad for some time and then do something to use that time.
-   Looking at the positive side of good and bad things/situations and learning from them helps a LOT.
-   Understanding oneself, talking to oneself, having faith and giving oneself some leeway is important, especially during difficult times. Realisations from such situations can be implemented next time a similar situation arises. The current 'waste' of time is a kind of a learning. It's okay. (Refer to previous point.)
-   Everything happens for a reason, which one comes to know after they connect the dots in hindsight.
    -   Learning from hindsight is extremely important and implementing it is even more important. (Currently struggling a lot with implementation.)
-   When one door closes, another one does open up.
-   Being a decent human being > money
-   Do it, even if one thinks people will laugh at them. It takes guts and if it is the correct thing, then definitely go for it.
-   When scared of doing something or approaching something or someone, just go for it. It builds confidence over time.
    -   Credits to [Tushar Nankani](https://twitter.com/tusharnankanii) for teaching this to me by demonstration.
-   Most people seem intimidating, but aren't once one starts talking to them. Everyone is Human.
    -   Also, talk to people and show one's curiosity. Forget about all the 'Networking' and other stuff.
-   Be you, even if someone ridicules and do what one believes is correct.
    -   Obviously if someone is providing constructive criticism, listen to them.
-   It's NOT all and always about money or being 'a means to an end'.
-   People can make out when one is doing something out of pure fun or with some spurious intentions. Time always tells.
-   Discipline and planning are underrated.
-   Free or paid, everything is a tradeoff. Time is the entity being traded. Time is SO important.
    -   Eg: Should I be writing these points right now? I don't know. That's the problem. Lesser planning on my end and I'm paying by putting in time typing this and maybe missing out on more important stuff.
    -   Credits to [Anil Harwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani) for making me aware about this.
-   Planning
    -   Plan days, weeks and months. (Still to do this properly. There is no time.)
    -   Plan the next day properly one night before. Make solid plan from the planning made for the week. (Again, very difficult to implement. I am struggling with this, but it has been helping whenever I do it.)
-   Getting priorities straight is SO important, but oh-so-difficult to put in practice.
    -   Credits to [Anil Harwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani) for making me aware about this.
-   Trust and impressions are very important, and it is difficult to get them back once the illusion (if present) shatters.
-   Building confidence in oneself is a process that takes time and getting into a groove to reach there.
-   If not sure of a talk or workshop, write down the points and anecdotes (preferably host it in public), and if someone is able to gain value from reading that (yes, write it like that), then the talk/workshop will add value. (Eg: [The contents of my CORS talk](https://talks.harshkapadia.me/cors/content))
-   '[Unfortunately, as it often happens, there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution.](https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-udp/#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20as%20it%20often%20happens%2C%20there%20is%20nothing%20more%20permanent%20than%20a%20temporary%20solution.)' is SO true.

_28th September 2022_

_On a sofa in BU Central, GSU Basement, Boston_

-   Having people one trusts is a boon.
    -   It is VERY important to not break trust.
-   Prioritising time is VERY important, but then unplanned stuff has done wonders for me (or is that [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)?).
    -   I don't know which one is better. It depends on one's guts and the situation, I guess.
    -   Eg: Should I be writing this right now? No. Am I? Yes. Why? I don't know. Maybe to vent? I'm just frustated at myself, I guess. I need to learn to handle pressure better, I guess.
-   EVERYTHING IS NOT A COMPETITION.
    -   I am tired of seeing competition everywhere. I'm mostly dumb and na√Øve, so maybe I'll learn better.
    -   Getting inspired rather than intimidated is better, but one should be careful of the qualities one is being inspired by.
    -   We should try to be better than ourselves, rather than others, but we shouldn't let it become toxic.
-   Appropriate sleep and food are so important.
-   Most of the stuff that our parents have been telling us about the clich√© quotes and habits, are true.
-   We really need to stop judging people.
    -   We all do a lot of shit and we don't have our lives in order, no matter what we think we know.
-   No one know what they're up to or where they will end up. Yes, NO ONE, no matter what they say. Everyone is struggling.
-   Everyone is struggling and is sad, no matter what they show. We need to be kinder and less judgemental.
-   Well-meaning unsolicited advice can hurt a stranger. We need to be careful or just shut up and let them figure it out (but not shut up out of competing against them).
-   Most times, in my opinion, try not to make the opposite person feel bad about themselves or their situation. Try to help and make them understand things. Sometimes, it is important to corner people, but be careful. It's not a good place to be in (but maybe that is what is required?).
-   'Fake it till you make it.' irritates me to no end. It's so toxic and false. Let the world work by that principle. I don't care. It's too toxic and just not real. My opinion. Probably an immature one, but who knows what the future holds and I might change this thought.
-   It is good to be outside one's comfort zone to a certain degree, because it forces one to learn to handle pressure, be better and unlearn toxic habits.
-   The people one surrounds oneself with and the content they consume dictates one who they are.
-   Being honest to oneself about something is so important, no matter how toxic or hurtful it is. It helps in improving.

_25th September 2022_

_My rented room in Boston, after attending a party, being sober (Why did I add this? I don't want people to judge me. Toxic, I know.) and taking care of drunk people. I sent these to [Tushar Nankani](https://twitter.com/tusharnankanii) on WhatsApp._

-   Everyone is sad and dealing with their own _shit_ all the time.

_On a call with Tushar._

-   Where is the passion? Is it all about the job and about 'a means to an end'? (I cried.)

_23rd September 2022_

_I don't remember where I was. I sent these to [Tushar Nankani](https://twitter.com/tusharnankanii) on WhatsApp._

-   Discipline is SO very important. I cannot stress on it enough.
-   Getting thrown in an absolutely new environment is overwhelming, but is good in the long run, as one learns to adapt and be more responsible. Planning and prioritising time becomes inevitable.
-   Insecurity sucks, but one should get to the root of why one is feeling that way and be better, FOR ONESELF and NOT for others.
-   Being overwhelmed and mind blown to the extent of not being able to think is good. These moments should be limited though.
-   We should all be less judgemental, kinder and more empathetic. Everyone is struggling, no matter what they show.
-   At least one = whole - none
