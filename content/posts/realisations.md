The following are some of my realisations and frustrations. Not facts. Just my opinions. All thoughts are not covered, obviously.

I'll try to keep this updated. No promises though, I guess.

_On a sofa in BU Central, GSU Basement, Boston_

-   Having people one trusts is a boon.
    -   It is VERY important to not break trust.
-   Prioritising time is VERY important, but then unplanned stuff has done wonders for me (or is that [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)?).
    -   I don't know which one is better. It depends on one's guts and the situation, I guess.
    -   Eg: Should I be writing this right now? No. Am I? Yes. Why? I don't know. Maybe to vent? I'm just frustated at myself, I guess. I need to learn to handle pressure better, I guess.
-   EVERYTHING IS NOT A COMPETITION.
    -   I am tired of seeing competition everywhere. I'm mostly dumb and naïve, so maybe I'll learn better.
    -   Getting inspired rather than intimidated is better, but one should be careful of the qualities one is being inspired by.
    -   We should try to be better than ourselves, rather than others, but we shouldn't let it become toxic.
-   Appropriate sleep and food are so important.
-   Most of the stuff that our parents have been telling us about the cliché quotes and habits, are true.
-   We really need to stop judging people.
    -   We all do a lot of shit and we don't have our lives in order, no matter what we think we know.
-   No one know what they're up to or where they will end up. Yes, NO ONE, no matter what they say. Everyone is struggling.
-   Everyone is struggling and is sad, no matter what they show. We need to be kinder and less judgemental.
-   Well-meaning unsolicited advice can hurt a stranger. We need to be careful or just shut up and let them figure it out (but not shut up out of competing against them).
-   Most times, in my opinion, try not to make the opposite person feel bad about themselves or their situation. Try to help and make them understand things. Sometimes, it is important to corner people, but be careful. It's not a good place to be in (but maybe that is what is required?).
-   'Fake it till you make it.' irritates me to no end. It's so toxic and false. Let the world work by that principle. I don't care. It's too toxic and just not real. My opinion. Probably an immature one, but who knows what the future holds and I might change this thought.
-   It is good to be outside one's comfort zone to a certain degree, because it forces one to learn to handle pressure, be better and unlearn toxic habits.
-   The people one surrounds oneself with and the content they consume dictates one who they are.
-   Being honest to oneself about something is so important, no matter how toxic or hurtful it is. It helps in improving.

_My rented room in Boston, after attending a party, being sober (Why did I add this? I don't want people to judge me. Toxic, I know.) and taking care of drunk people. I sent these to [Tushar Nankani](https://twitter.com/tusharnankanii) on WhatsApp._

-   Everyone is sad and dealing with their own _shit_ all the time.

_On a call with Tushar._

-   Where is the passion? Is it all about the job and about 'a means to an end'? (I cried.)

_I don't remember where I was. I sent these to [Tushar Nankani](https://twitter.com/tusharnankanii) on WhatsApp._

-   Discipline is SO very important. I cannot stress on it enough.
-   Getting thrown in an absolutely new environment is overwhelming, but is gppd in the long run, as one learns to adapt and be more responsible. Planning and prioritising time becomes inevitable.
-   Insecurity sucks, but one should get to the root of why one is feeling that way and be better, FOR ONESELF and NOT for others.
-   Being overwhelmed and mind blown to the extent of not being able to think is good. These moments should be limited though.
-   We should all be less judgemental, kinder and more empathetic. Everyone is struggling, no matter what they show.
-   At least one = whole - none
