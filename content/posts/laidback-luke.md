# Introduction

Lucas Cornelis van Scheppingen, aka [Laidback Luke](https://laidbackluke.com), is a legendary DJ and producer who has been in the music industry for over 30 years. Some of his classic hits include [Show Me Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye8xyGI60Bk), [Leave The World Behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HMP36Jb0EM), [Turbulence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3OzHBEcymw) and [Rocking With The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QV67hOGqUc). He is widely known to be one of the nice and humble guys in the electronic music scene. He has helped and mentored a lot of people throughout his career and has shared a lot of his knowledge publicly through his weekly YouTube vlogs, his old forum page and his numerous talks, interviews and podcasts. Some of the artists he discovered and/or mentored include Avicii, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Oliver Heldens, Deorro, Nicky Romero, GTA and Bingo Players.

The day this blog post is being released (22nd Oct 2025), is Luke's 49th birthday! Happy birthday, Luke! ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for everything!

# Personal Note

Personally, I have been a fan of Luke for over 10 years now and he has inspired me in ways that changed my life. I also made a [tribute page](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/lbl-tribute-page) for him five years ago when I was learning to build websites! Although I'm not in the music industry at all (just an avid listener), I've always been fascinated with DJing, and looking up stuff about DJing is how I discovered Luke's YouTube channel. I'm extremely grateful to have discovered his channel at a very vulnerable time in my life, because I got to learn a lot from him.

Some of my learnings from Luke over the years:

-   The attitude of sharing knowledge publicly and freely without expecting a return
-   Being a helpful person
-   Sharing poised and thought out opinions
-   Being honest and open about things, especially mistakes and the 'not-so-good' things one does
-   Sharing helpful tips from experience
-   Giving importance to fundamentals and raw skills
-   Being true to the art form (or anything in life)
-   Sharing his mistakes
-   His humility, empathy and 'down-to-earth-ness'
-   His 'easy-to-contact' and responsive persona
-   His focus on mental health alongside hard work
-   His positivity

Applying the above to my life over the years has really shaped me into a better person. I'm obviously a work in progress, but I've benefitted a LOT from applying these in my life over the last 10 years. What I've learnt seems obvious and common place, but applying them consistently have really changed things for me for the better. I like who I've become as a person. I'm super grateful to Luke for changing my life for the better. I am not saying that Luke is perfect by any means, because no one is, but I just wanted to acknowledge that I have learnt so much from him during a vulnerable stage in my life and I'm super grateful for that.

One of my favourite quotes from one of [Luke's vlogs](https://youtu.be/2Ob5_ER4pGo?t=619):

> Starting this, seeing this, tackling this, it seemed impossible to do and only with perseverance and really like a sense of like goal and being goal oriented, I was able to make this work... It might take some time, it might take a year, it might take two years, it might take four years and along the way there will be lot of failures, but I want you to be fueled by failures and never give up and eventually you will get where you want to be.

Through this blog post, I want to share some of my favourite Laidback Luke (LBL) videos where he shares good information, not only about music-related things, but about life in general. I intend to keep this page updated with things related to Luke that I like.
